===panel: Introduction
I played Maze's End Fog in Standard back in 2013. I fell in love with Gates since then. Navigating the matches and achieving a victory by activating Maze's End was incredibly rewarding.

I want to achieve something similar in EDH. I wish there was a 5 color Gates-matter commander, but [[Golos, Tireless Pilgrim]] is dead so here we are.

The following primer is only a dump of my thoughts regarding this deck. You can certainly play it in any way you want. Choose your counterspells or removal according to your own meta. Want to run a particular card? Go for it. Experiment. Have fun! The last section of this primer is for me to keep track of things that I tried and changed.

As the old Standard deck required serious thought about one-ofs and color balance, this deck can be modified according to your needs and what you consider fun.

[[Nine-Fingers Keene]] is a great Gates-matter commander. She has the right colors to provide excellent control of the field.

- Ward - Pay 9 life.
  - Once she enters the battlefield, it will be difficult to remove her using spot removal.
  - She is susceptible to counters, mass removal and sacrifice effects.
- Menace
  - It makes easy to hit opponents, allowing you to potentially ramp.
  - Always try to sneak a hit. Do not leave her to block duty.

===panel: Gates
You wouldn't be here if you didn't like gates. If you have strong opinions about lands entering tapped, the deck probably won't be for you.

During the game, keep count of the number of Gates you have. These number is important for many effects. For example:
- Basilisk Gate adds +X/+X where X is the Gate Count.
- At Gate Count 4, [[Baldur's Gate]] starts being mana neutral.
- At Gate Count 9, [[Nine-Fingers Keene]] will let you draw 9 cards.
- At Gate Count 10, [[Maze's End]] wins the game.
- [[Sage of the Maze]]'s manlands will be X/X where X is twice the Gate Count.

In Sultai color, we currently have 15 gates in total. Keep this in mind when [[Nine-Fingers Keene]] deals combat damage. The chance of seeing a Gate in the top 9 cards goes down as your Gate Count increases. It is common to miss a Gate with the trigger. Don't be let down by this. It happens.

Let's break down the Gates we are working with.

First we have Guildgates and Thriving Gates. The bread and butter. We have three Guildgates, one for each color pair available, and three Thriving Gates, one for each color.

The Thriving Gates have the advantage of letting you choose the second color, so they can provide better fixing according to your needs.

- Pros
  - Mana fixing
- Cons
  - Enter tapped

These are other gates that add color by themselves.

- [[Gateway Plaza]]
  - Can add any color. Good!
  - Enters tapped *and* you have to pay [[symbol:1]] to keep it. **Bad**.
  - If this enters untapped, at least it can pay itself. Prefer using colorless mana to pay for this though.
- [[Thran Portal]]
  - A fastland gate and basically our painland.
  - Can only generate one color. Pick the one you need at the moment.
- [[The Black Gate]]
  - An untapped source of [[symbol:b]].
- [[Gond Gate]]
  - By default adds [[symbol:c]], but can add colors of gates you control can produce.
  - Works great alongside [[Gateway Plaza]] and other filter gates, since they *can* produce mana of any color.

These gates tap for [[symbol:c]], but allow you to pay to add mana of any color.

- [[Baldur's Gate]]
  - Almost a [[Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx]] of gates. Note that it says *other* gates, so at Gate Count 4, it is neutral.
  - Can produce a lot of mana in the late game.
  - The mana you add is of only one type.
- [[Heap Gate]]
  - Pay [[symbol:1]] and tap to add one colored mana.
  - Can produce a Treasure token. This is really powerful. Always try to create one at the end of turn before your turn.
- [[Planar Nexus]]
  - Pay [[symbol:1]] and tap to add one colored mana.
  - In our deck, the land changeling is not that relevant. This is a Gate.
    - Cave type can help with [[Spelunking]].
- [[Talon Gates of Madara]]
  - Pay [[symbol:1]] and tap to add one colored mana.
  - We will talk about it's other abilities later.

Besides adding mana, we have gates with great abilities.

- [[Basilisk Gate]]
  - For [[symbol:2]], it pumps a creature by your Gate Count.
  - This ability is incredible for [[Nine-Fingers Keene]], allowing you to threaten lethal commander damage.
- [[The Black Gate]]
  - For [[symbol:1]][[symbol:b]], it can make [[Nine-Fingers Keene]] unblockable by the player with the most life. This won't do anything if that player is you though.
- [[Talon Gates of Madara]]
  - Think about it as a cost [[symbol:4]] spot removal.
  - You can pay [[symbol:4]] to let it enter the battlefield. You can use it to increase your Gate Count as an instant. This can let [[Nine-Fingers Keene]] draw you 9 cards, or speed up a [[Maze's End]] win.
  - Amazing with instant speed land tutors, like [[Crop Rotation]] or [[Maze's End]].
- [[Gond Gate]]
  - The ability to let your gates enter untapped is really important. If you can tutor a land, consider this one first.

The main reason we are here for. When [[Maze's End]] ability resolves, if your Gate Count is 10, it wins the game. Well, it needs 10 gates with different names, but you get the idea. [[Maze's End]] is not a Gate, sadly.

- Tips
  - If your Gate Count is high, you can sandbag a Gate in your hand. That way, when Gate Count is 8, you can play it and activate Maze's End for the win.
  - If your Gate Count is 9 or more, you are very likely to win by drawing 9 off a [[Nine-Fingers Keene]] hit. You will need an untapper and a land tutor for [[Maze's End]]. This will require a lot of mana, but at this point [[Baldur's Gate]]  should provide it.
  - Lowest Gate Count for a win I can think of is 6, if you have an untapper, [[Maze's End]] in play, and a 2-gate tutor (e.g. [[Circuitous Route]]). Well, 5 if you count on [[Nine-Fingers Keene]] getting a Gate but I wouldn't go for it.

Don't be afraid to use it as a ramp engine. The gate it fetches does not enters the battlefield tapped.

Important targets are:
- [[Gond Gate]] is a good early target.
- [[Basilisk Gate]] if you need to move into the Beatdown plan.
- [[The Black Gate]] if you already have [[Basilisk Gate]].
- [[Talon Gates of Madara]] if you need to phase out a creature.
- [[Baldur's Gate]] if you need a lot of mana.

By herself, [[Nine-Fingers Keene]] can kill a player in 6 turns. This is not that much, but the clock drastically decreases with [[Basilisk Gate]]. [[The Black Gate]] can provide additional evasion.

[[Sage of the Maze]]'s ability to produce a manland puts incredible pressure in opponents. You can turn any land with this ability, so prioritize non-Gate lands first.

Yeah, I know. I can hear you booing. This combo can win you the game out of nowhere. You can always replace this package if you want. Bonus points for [[Tainted Pact]] too. It's always nice to have as a tool to look for answers when you need them, as long as you don't exile your [[Maze's End]].

===panel: Land Tutors
Ramp and tutor lands is important. In the early game, you want to fix your mana. In the mid game, you want to look for utility lands. In the late game, you want [[Maze's End]] to finish the game. If you are going to ramp, make sure to hit with [[Nine-Fingers Keene]] first! You want to keep your Gates in the deck to maximize the chances of getting one with [[Nine-Fingers Keene]]'s trigger.

Some tips for ramping with [[Nine-Fingers Keene]]:
- Always make sure to attack before you tutor. You want to keep your Gates in the deck to maximize the chances of getting one with its trigger.
- In the rare case you see a lot of Gates in the 9, you can always tutor to shuffle them and increase your odds.
- After many triggers that don't get you a Gate, consider not shuffling. Those cards in the bottom of your library increase the odds of gates in the cards above.

General tutors such as [[Vampiric Tutor]] and [[Demonic Tutor]] can be used as a [[Sylvan Scrying]] if you need. Use [[Mystical Tutor]] to look for ramp or land tutors.

Instant speed tutors that can look for [[Talon Gates of Madara]] are important.
- [[Elvish Reclaimer]] (always prioritize sacrificing non-Gate lands)
- [[Maze's End]]
- [[Crop Rotation]]
- [[Navigation Orb]]

Having gates (and lands) enter untapped is a huge advantage.

We have:
- [[Amulet of Vigor]]
- [[Spelunking]]
- [[Tiller Engine]]
- [[Gond Gate]] (gates only)

These allow [[Maze's End]] to enter untapped, making it a very strong ramp engine. Alongside [[Burgeoning]], this can give you a lot of lands in a turn cycle.

Both [[Amulet of Vigor]] and [[Tiller Engine]] are triggers, so if you have both, you can ramp one mana or use [[Tiller Engine]]'s tap ability. Keep in mind they won't trigger with [[Spelunking]] or [[Gond Gate]], so having multiples can actually hurt.

===accordion
===panel: Thoughts on particular cards
- [[Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath]] *(tried and removed)*
  - One time draw, lifegain and ramp if not escaped.
  - Feels like an expensive [[Growth Spiral]] most of the times. And sorcery too.
  - Maybe works in the long term, but lack of fetchlands hurts this plan.
- [[Tainted Pact]]
  - Probably Demonic Consultation is more than enough, though the idea of having a tool to look for an answer in times of need sounds appealing.
- [[Suspend]]
  - Maybe change to [[Pongify]] or another creature-based removal. Well, not really. See below.
  - Nine-Fingers' games take long, so the suspended creature will come back, eventually.
- [[Pongify]] / [[Rapid Hybridization]] / [[Beast Within]] *(tried and removed)*
  - Good removals, but giving a 3/3 to the opponent can actually hurt.
  - The 3/3 alongside a 1/1 can block Nine-Fingers.
- [[Roaming Throne]] *(tried and removed)*
  - Tapping out for this is a bad idea. It's a little too slow.
  - Double trigger sounds good, but Nine-Fingers can miss, so it might be frustrating.
- [[Omo, Vesuvan Queen]] *(tried and removed)*
  - Can tick up the Gate Count
  - Huge downside is that the type-granting is a static ability of Omo. If removed, the lands will keep the counters, but lose the types.
- [[Worldly Tutor]]
  - Can fetch [[Thassa's Oracle]], but other than that, the creature list is very limited. Consider tutoring [[Sage of the Maze]] if you need to pivot towards a beatdown plan.
  - Can fetch some silver bullets like [[Opposition Agent]].
- [[Sunken Citadel]]
  - We have many lands with activated abilities. Most relevant ones are [[Baldur's Gate]], [[Basilisk Gate]] and of course [[Maze's End]]. I'd choose [[symbol:b]] for [[The Black Gate]], but it can depend on your needs.
  - Other lands this can pay for are [[Boseiju, Who Endures]], [[Otawara, Soaring City]], [[Castle Vantress]], [[Talon Gates of Madara]], [[Tolaria West]], [[Urza's Cave]]. There are many! (Also [[Urza's Saga]] but you probably won't be activating that one).

Doing that two turns in a row can mean you lose the game.</p>
    <p>Replacing it for Tiller Engine, which is another untapper (great thing to have). Note that it's a trigger when lands enter tapped, so it works great with Amulet.

    <p>I've been noticing that Nine-FIngers games go to the late game, and in those scenarios, the players with draw engines have the advantage (specially if you don't have one). Notion Thief helps in those scenarios. Having flash is amazing as well, you can play it before your turn.</p>

Bowmasters can punish those engines and remove creatures as well. See [[Notion Thief]] above, just in case.</p>
    <p>The orcs also have flash, so it's even better than I thought it would be in the deck. It's one of those cards you know are strong, but don't realize how strong they are until you play them.</p>

    <td>[[Stubborn Denial]]</td>
    <td>Miscast is awful in the late game. With Nine-Fingers in play, you have Ferocious.</td>

    <td>[[Farseek]]</td>
    <td>[[Burgeoning]]</td>
    <td>Too few targets.</td>

    <td>[[Sword of Feast and Famine]]</td>
    <td>Haste is nice, but Nine-Fingers needs evasion, not shroud. Untapping lands is also nice.</td>

    <td>By the moment your Gate Count is 9, the game should be finishing very soon. Worldly Tutor can look for tax pieces or Thassa's Oracle.</td>
