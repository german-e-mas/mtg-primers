===panel: Introduction
I played Maze's End Fog in Standard back in 2013. I fell in love with Gates since then. Navigating the matches and achieving a victory by activating Maze's End was incredibly rewarding.

I want to achieve something similar in EDH. I wish there was a 5 color Gates-matter commander, but [[Golos, Tireless Pilgrim]] is dead so here we are.

The following primer is only a dump of my thoughts regarding this deck. You can certainly play it in any way you want. Choose your counterspells or removal according to your own meta. Want to run a particular card? Go for it. Experiment. Have fun! The last section of this primer is for me to keep track of things that I tried and changed.

As the old Standard deck required serious thought about one-ofs and color balance, this deck can be modified according to your needs and what you consider fun.

[[Nine-Fingers Keene]] is a great Gates-matter commander. She has the right colors to provide excellent control of the field.

- Ward - Pay 9 life.
  - Once she enters the battlefield, it will be difficult to remove her using spot removal.
  - She is susceptible to counters, mass removal and sacrifice effects.
- Menace
  - It makes easy to hit opponents, allowing you to potentially ramp.
  - Always try to sneak a hit. Do not leave her to block duty.

===panel: Gates
You wouldn't be here if you didn't like gates. If you have strong opinions about lands entering tapped, the deck probably won't be for you.

During the game, keep count of the number of Gates you have. These number is important for many effects. For example:
- Basilisk Gate adds +X/+X where X is the Gate Count.
- At Gate Count 4, [[Baldur's Gate]] starts being mana neutral.
- At Gate Count 9, [[Nine-Fingers Keene]] will let you draw 9 cards.
- At Gate Count 10, [[Maze's End]] wins the game.
- [[Sage of the Maze]]'s manlands will be X/X where X is twice the Gate Count.

In Sultai color, we currently have 15 gates in total. Keep this in mind when [[Nine-Fingers Keene]] deals combat damage. The chance of seeing a Gate in the top 9 cards goes down as your Gate Count increases. It is common to miss a Gate with the trigger. Don't be let down by this. It happens.

Let's break down the Gates we are working with.

First we have Guildgates and Thriving Gates. The bread and butter. We have three Guildgates, one for each color pair available, and three Thriving Gates, one for each color.

The Thriving Gates have the advantage of letting you choose the second color, so they can provide better fixing according to your needs.

- Pros
  - Mana fixing
- Cons
  - Enter tapped

These are other gates that add color by themselves.

- [[Gateway Plaza]]
  - Can add any color. Good!
  - Enters tapped *and* you have to pay [[symbol:1]] to keep it. **Bad**.
  - If this enters untapped, at least it can pay itself. Prefer using colorless mana to pay for this though.
- [[Thran Portal]]
  - A fastland gate and basically our painland.
  - Can only generate one color. Pick the one you need at the moment.
- [[The Black Gate]]
  - An untapped source of [[symbol:b]].
- [[Gond Gate]]
  - By default adds [[symbol:c]], but can add colors of gates you control can produce.
  - Works great alongside [[Gateway Plaza]] and other filter gates, since they *can* produce mana of any color.

These gates tap for [[symbol:c]], but allow you to pay to add mana of any color.

- [[Baldur's Gate]]
  - Almost a [[Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx]] of gates. Note that it says *other* gates, so at Gate Count 4, it is neutral.
  - Can produce a lot of mana in the late game.
  - The mana you add is of only one type.
- [[Heap Gate]]
  - Pay [[symbol:1]] and tap to add one colored mana.
  - Can produce a Treasure token. This is really powerful. Always try to create one at the end of turn before your turn.
- [[Planar Nexus]]
  - Pay [[symbol:1]] and tap to add one colored mana.
  - In our deck, the land changeling is not that relevant. This is a Gate.
    - Cave type can help with [[Spelunking]].
- [[Talon Gates of Madara]]
  - Pay [[symbol:1]] and tap to add one colored mana.
  - We will talk about it's other abilities later.

Besides adding mana, we have gates with great abilities.

- [[Basilisk Gate]]
  - For [[symbol:2]], it pumps a creature by your Gate Count.
  - This ability is incredible for [[Nine-Fingers Keene]], allowing you to threaten lethal commander damage.
- [[The Black Gate]]
  - For [[symbol:1]][[symbol:b]], it can make [[Nine-Fingers Keene]] unblockable by the player with the most life. This won't do anything if that player is you though.
- [[Talon Gates of Madara]]
  - Think about it as a cost [[symbol:4]] spot removal.
  - You can pay [[symbol:4]] to let it enter the battlefield. You can use it to increase your Gate Count as an instant. This can let [[Nine-Fingers Keene]] draw you 9 cards, or speed up a [[Maze's End]] win.
  - Amazing with instant speed land tutors, like [[Crop Rotation]] or [[Maze's End]].
- [[Gond Gate]]
  - The ability to let your gates enter untapped is really important. If you can tutor a land, consider this one first.

The main reason we are here for. When [[Maze's End]] ability resolves, if your Gate Count is 10, it wins the game. Well, it needs 10 gates with different names, but you get the idea. [[Maze's End]] is not a Gate, sadly.

- Tips
  - If your Gate Count is high, you can sandbag a Gate in your hand. That way, when Gate Count is 8, you can play it and activate Maze's End for the win.
  - If your Gate Count is 9 or more, you are very likely to win by drawing 9 off a [[Nine-Fingers Keene]] hit. You will need an untapper and a land tutor for [[Maze's End]]. This will require a lot of mana, but at this point [[Baldur's Gate]]  should provide it.
  - Lowest Gate Count for a win I can think of is 6, if you have an untapper, [[Maze's End]] in play, and a 2-gate tutor (e.g. [[Circuitous Route]]). Well, 5 if you count on [[Nine-Fingers Keene]] getting a Gate but I wouldn't go for it.

Don't be afraid to use it as a ramp engine. The gate it fetches does not enters the battlefield tapped.

Important targets are:
- [[Gond Gate]] is a good early target.
- [[Basilisk Gate]] if you need to move into the Beatdown plan.
- [[The Black Gate]] if you already have [[Basilisk Gate]].
- [[Talon Gates of Madara]] if you need to phase out a creature.
- [[Baldur's Gate]] if you need a lot of mana.

By herself, [[Nine-Fingers Keene]] can kill a player in 6 turns. This is not that much, but the clock drastically decreases with [[Basilisk Gate]]. [[The Black Gate]] can provide additional evasion.

[[Sage of the Maze]]'s ability to produce a manland puts incredible pressure in opponents. You can turn any land with this ability, so prioritize non-Gate lands first.

Yeah, I know. I can hear you booing. This combo can win you the game out of nowhere. You can always replace this package if you want. Bonus points for [[Tainted Pact]] too. It's always nice to have as a tool to look for answers when you need them, as long as you don't exile your [[Maze's End]].

===panel: Land Tutors
Ramp and tutor lands is important. In the early game, you want to fix your mana. In the mid game, you want to look for utility lands. In the late game, you want [[Maze's End]] to finish the game. If you are going to ramp, make sure to hit with [[Nine-Fingers Keene]] first! You want to keep your Gates in the deck to maximize the chances of getting one with [[Nine-Fingers Keene]]'s trigger.

Some tips for ramping with [[Nine-Fingers Keene]]:
- Always make sure to attack before you tutor. You want to keep your Gates in the deck to maximize the chances of getting one with its trigger.
- In the rare case you see a lot of Gates in the 9, you can always tutor to shuffle them and increase your odds.
- After many triggers that don't get you a Gate, consider not shuffling. Those cards in the bottom of your library increase the odds of gates in the cards above.

General tutors such as [[Vampiric Tutor]] and [[Demonic Tutor]] can be used as a [[Sylvan Scrying]] if you need. Use [[Mystical Tutor]] to look for ramp or land tutors.

Instant speed tutors that can look for [[Talon Gates of Madara]] are important.
- [[Elvish Reclaimer]] (always prioritize sacrificing non-Gate lands)
- [[Maze's End]]
- [[Crop Rotation]]
- [[Navigation Orb]]

Having gates (and lands) enter untapped is a huge advantage.

We have:
- [[Amulet of Vigor]]
- [[Spelunking]]
- [[Tiller Engine]]
- [[Gond Gate]] (gates only)

These allow [[Maze's End]] to enter untapped, making it a very strong ramp engine. Alongside [[Burgeoning]], this can give you a lot of lands in a turn cycle.

Both [[Amulet of Vigor]] and [[Tiller Engine]] are triggers, so if you have both, you can ramp one mana or use [[Tiller Engine]]'s tap ability. Keep in mind they won't trigger with [[Spelunking]] or [[Gond Gate]], so having multiples can actually hurt.

===accordion
===panel: Thoughts on particular cards
- [[Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath]] *(tried and removed)*
  - One time draw, lifegain and ramp if not escaped.
  - Feels like an expensive [[Growth Spiral]] most of the times. And sorcery too.
  - Maybe works in the long term, but lack of fetchlands hurts this plan.
- [[Tainted Pact]]
  - Probably Demonic Consultation is more than enough, though the idea of having a tool to look for an answer in times of need sounds appealing.
- [[Suspend]]
  - Maybe change to [[Pongify]] or another creature-based removal. Well, not really. See below.
  - Nine-Fingers' games take long, so the suspended creature will come back, eventually.
- [[Pongify]] / [[Rapid Hybridization]] / [[Beast Within]] *(tried and removed)*
  - Good removals, but giving a 3/3 to the opponent can actually hurt.
  - The 3/3 alongside a 1/1 can block Nine-Fingers.
- [[Roaming Throne]] *(tried and removed)*
  - Tapping out for this is a bad idea. It's a little too slow.
  - Double trigger sounds good, but Nine-Fingers can miss, so it might be frustrating.
- [[Omo, Vesuvan Queen]] *(tried and removed)*
  - Can tick up the Gate Count
  - Huge downside is that the type-granting is a static ability of Omo. If removed, the lands will keep the counters, but lose the types.
- [[Worldly Tutor]]
  - Can fetch [[Thassa's Oracle]], but other than that, the creature list is very limited. Consider tutoring [[Sage of the Maze]] if you need to pivot towards a beatdown plan.
  - Can fetch some silver bullets like [[Opposition Agent]].
- [[Sunken Citadel]]
  - We have many lands with activated abilities. Most relevant ones are [[Baldur's Gate]], [[Basilisk Gate]] and of course [[Maze's End]]. I'd choose [[symbol:b]] for [[The Black Gate]], but it can depend on your needs.
  - Other lands this can pay for are [[Boseiju, Who Endures]], [[Otawara, Soaring City]], [[Castle Vantress]], [[Talon Gates of Madara]], [[Tolaria West]], [[Urza's Cave]]. There are many! (Also [[Urza's Saga]] but you probably won't be activating that one).

Doing that two turns in a row can mean you lose the game.</p>
    <p>Replacing it for Tiller Engine, which is another untapper (great thing to have). Note that it's a trigger when lands enter tapped, so it works great with Amulet. Spelunking or Gond Gate will not make it trigger. Sadly if you have another untapper, Tiller Engine is a somewhat dead draw.</p></td>

    <p>I've been noticing that Nine-FIngers games go to the late game, and in those scenarios, the players with draw engines have the advantage (specially if you don't have one). Notion Thief helps in those scenarios. Having flash is amazing as well, you can play it before your turn.</p>

Bowmasters can punish those engines and remove creatures as well. See [[Notion Thief]] above, just in case.</p>
    <p>The orcs also have flash, so it's even better than I thought it would be in the deck. It's one of those cards you know are strong, but don't realize how strong they are until you play them.</p>

[[Purphoros, God of the Forge]] for a local league.

- $400 USD budget.
  - Basic lands don't count towards the budget.
  - This is checked by clicking "Update to Cheapest" periodically.
- No mana positive rocks, except [[Sol Ring]].

---

===accordion
===panel: Win Conditions and how to play

Win Condition? I mean, look at [[Purphoros, God of the Forge]].

You need 20 triggers to kill all your opponents. This halves if you have a damage enhancer. We have combo lines to close games quickly as well.

We have lots of creatures, You can lower life points with good ol' combat damage. Purphoros also can enhance creature power, so a swarm of creatures can really eliminate one opponent after the other. If a goblin token can deal more than 2 damage to an opponent, Purphoros smiles.

---

Don't try to keep life totals balanced. You will lose if you play nice and try to distribute damage equally. Pick the opponent that you know will combo you out or control you, and remove them. Nothing personal. Others will follow their fate.

Everyone will quickly realize that you are sort of an archenemy. All life points will lower except yours. At this point, expect all the hate to go towards you. It happens. Don't feel bad or angry about it. If you don't like to be in that position, maybe this deck isn't for you.

---

[[Purphoros, God of the Forge]] is indestructible and incredibly hard to remove.

Be careful if it becomes a creature, as it will be exposed to a lot of removal such as [[Swords to Plowshares]] and [[Path to Exile]]. Play with your Devotion and be careful not to over commit. Of course, Purphoros can punch for 6+, so it's worth to have it as a creature. Even as an indestructible blocker. Find the balance you need in each match. If there's a lot of white or blue, it will be exiled or returned to your hand at the worst moment.

---

Play [[Purphoros, God of the Forge]] fast. You can do it as early as turn 3 with mana rocks, or turn 2 with a turn 1 [[Sol Ring]].

===panel: Some creature choices / thoughts

- [[Norin the Wary]]
  - I consider Norin as a staple. Each turn it should deal 4 triggers worth of damage. Games are blazing fast when Norin and Purphoros are in play.
- [[Ornithopter of Paradise]], [[Iron Myr]]
  - Only used as a turn 2 drop to have a turn 3 Purphoros.
  - Can trigger Purphoros if played afterwards.
  - Used to fit the budget. I'd rather have ~~Mana Crypt~~ and ~~Jeweled Lotus~~.
    - Oh wait...
- [[Chandra's Spitfire]]
  - Against 3 opponents, one Purphoros' trigger causes 3 [[Chandra's Spitfire]]'s triggers, adding +9. This can end a player very quickly.
- [[Breya's Apprentice]], [[Redcap Gutter-Dweller]], [[Professional Face-Breaker]]
  - The extra tokens and Purphoros triggers are welcome.
  - The draw is more important though. This can help your [[Conspicuous Snoop]] combo line.
- [[Neheb, the Eternal]]
  - An absolute powerhouse.
  - The turn it comes into play, it should add at least 6 [[symbol:r]].
  - If you have a lot of [[symbol:r]], you can finish the game with a big token generator spell like [[Tempt with Vengeance]].
  - You can kickstart the mana generation by looping [[Grinning Ignus]] in your main phase, add a ton of [[symbol:r]] then continue looping it in your second main phase. This is not infinite, but can be large enough to finish the game.

===panel: Some land choices / thoughts

- Fetchlands
  - Can fetch [[Dwarven mine]], which can trigger Purphoros.
  - I'd run 4 red fetchlands, but this hurts the budget.
- [[Ghost Quarter]], [[Demolition Field]]
  - Purelly a meta call against [[Glacial Chasm]]. Don't run these.
  - Took 2 mountains out for these. I don't think the colorless mana will impact the deck much.
- [[Roadside Reliquary]], [[War Room]]
  - Draw in my lands? Yes please!
  - Roadside usually draws 2, with Purphoros as Enchantment.
  - The draw can help your [[Conspicuous Snoop]] combo line.
- [[Arena of Glory]]
  - I was hesitant but this can cast a hasty [[Conspicuous Snoop]], so I'm sold on it.

Whatever floats your boat, but make sure you can remove [[Drannith Magistrate]] or [[Torpor Orb]]. These are such a headache.

===panel: Damage enhancers

Cards that increase or duplicate damage are great. Prefer creatures, such as [[Solphim, Mayhem Dominus]] instead of enchantments like [[Furnace of Rath]]. You can take advantage of an enhanced trigger once they enter the battlefield. The enchantments do not trigger [[Purphoros, God of the Forge]].

Keep in mind that, since the opponent is the one receiving the damage, they have to choose how these apply.

Let's say you have [[Solphim, Mayhem Dominus]] and [[Torbran, Thane of Red Fell]]. Each trigger should deal `(2+2)*2=8` damage, but no, your opponent should chose the trigger to deal them `2*2+2=6` damage. As you see, the damage calculations can get messy with multiple enhancers.

By itself, the best enhancers in my opinion are:
1. [[Torbran, Thane of Red Fell]]
  - Torbran enhances all damage from red sources. This includes combat damage, so things can get out of hand pretty quickly.
  - If paired with [[Impact Tremors]], each ETB will deal 7 damage (4 from [[Purphoros, God of the Forge]], 3 from [[Impact Tremors]]).
2. [[Ojer Axonil, Deepest Might // Temple of Power]]
  - Axonil only enhances non-combat damage.
  - If paired with [[Impact Tremors]], each ETB will deal 8 damage (4 from [[Purphoros, God of the Forge]], 4 from [[Impact Tremors]]).
  - You can pump Axonil with [[Purphoros, God of the Forge]]'s ability to deal more damage.
3. [[Solphim, Mayhem Dominus]]
  - Solphim only enhances non-combat damage.
  - If paired with [[Impact Tremors]], each ETB will deal 6 damage (4 from [[Purphoros, God of the Forge]], 2 from [[Impact Tremors]]).
  - This also doubles non-combat damage dealt to permanents, so [[Chandra's Incinerator]] will burn everything down.

From these, [[Ojer Axonil, Deepest Might // Temple of Power]] is the worst to pair with other enhancers. After the first enhancement, the damage is usually equal or greater than Axonil's power, therefore not affecting it.

===accordion
===panel: Conspicuous Snoop

If you have [[Conspicuous Snoop]] (without summoning sickness) and [[Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker]] on top of your deck, you can activate [[Conspicuous Snoop]] to make a hasty copy of itself and repeat the process. [[Goblin Recruiter]] can stack the top of your deck to cast the required goblins you need, and set [[Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker]] to pull the combo.

This works much better if you can draw a card. This way, you can play [[Goblin Recruiter]], put [[Conspicuous Snoop]] on top, draw it and proceed with the combo.

===accordion
===panel: Conspicuous Snoop + Torch Courier + Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker

Requires:
- [[Goblin Recruiter]] in hand.
- A way to draw a card.
- An ETB payoff.
- [[symbol:1]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]]
  - [[symbol:1]][[symbol:r]] for [[Goblin Recruiter]]
  - [[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]] for [[Conspicuous Snoop]]
  - [[symbol:r]] for [[Torch Courier]]

Execution:
1. Cast [[Goblin Recruiter]].
2. Tutor [[Conspicuous Snoop]], [[Torch Courier]] and [[Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker]]. Put them back in the top of your library in that order ([[Conspicuous Snoop]] should be on top).
3. Draw a card.
4. Cast [[Conspicuous Snoop]].
5. Cast [[Torch Courier]] from the top of your library. [[Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker]] should be on top of your library now.
6. Activate [[Torch Courier]] to give [[Conspicuous Snoop]] haste.
7. Activate [[Conspicuous Snoop]] to make a copy of itself.
8. Repeat step 7.

Outcome:
- Infinite ETB triggers of your payoff.

Observations:
- Be mindful of the number of cards you draw ([[Skullclamp]], [[Harnfel, Horn of Bounty]]). Look for an extra goblin if you want to keep [[Torch Courier]] on top. Although you can draw it and play it from your hand or exile regardless.
- If you have other ways to give [[Conspicuous Snoop]] haste, you can skip [[Torch Courier]].
- You can reduce the cost by [[symbol:r]] by looking for [[Skirk Prospector]] and placing it before [[Torch Courier]]. This lets you sacrifice [[Goblin Recruiter]] for an extra [[symbol:r]].

===accordion
===panel: No ETB payoff

What if you don't have [[Purphoros, God of the Forge]] or any other ETB payoff? The infinite copies of [[Conspicuous Snoop]] are tapped, and cannot attack. What do we do?

Requires:
- Infinite [[Conspicuous Snoop]] in play (by executing the previous combo)
- [[Goblin Recruiter]] in play.
- [[Skirk Prospector]] in play or library.
- [[Pashalik Mons]] in play or library.

Execution:
1. After you have infinite [[Conspicuous Snoop]], tap the last one to copy [[Goblin Recruiter]] instead of itself.
2. With the copied [[Goblin Recruiter]], tutor [[Skirk Prospector]] and [[Pashalik Mons]] to the top of your deck, in that order.
3. Sacrifice [[Conspicuous Snoop]]s to add [[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]].
4. Cast [[Skirk Prospector]] from the top.
5. Cast [[Pashalik Mons]] from the top.
6. Pass the turn. All [[Conspicuous Snoop]] will have to be sacrificed, each triggering [[Pashalik Mons]] enough times for you to win.

Outcome:
- Infinite [[Pashalik Mons]] triggers, dealing infinite damage.

Observations:
- If you have enough copies of [[Conspicuous Snoop]], you can use [[Skirk Prospector]] to sacrifice them and trigger [[Pashalik Mons]] in response to anything.

===panel: Grinning Ignus

I love this creature. An amazing mana sink by itself. When looping [[Grinning Ignus]] for triggers, always be mindful about what zone should it end, in your hand or in the battlefield.

Say you have [[symbol:2]][[symbol:r]] to cast your [[Grinning Ignus]] for the first time and then N [[symbol:r]] mana available. You will have N additional Purphoros triggers, or (N-1) if [[Grinning Ignus]] ends in your hand (leaving [[symbol:2]][[symbol:r]] available).

If you have cost reducers such as [[Ruby Medallion]] or [[Hazoret's Monument]], each iteration will leave [[symbol:1]] available.

If you have [[Defiler of Instinct]], each iteration costs [[symbol:rp]], so if you have more life than your opponents, this can win you the game.

===accordion
===panel: Grinning Ignus + Birgi, God of Storytelling

Requires:
- [[Birgi, God of Storytelling]] and [[Grinning Ignus]] in hand.
- An ETB payoff.
- [[symbol:4]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]]
  - If [[Birgi, God of Storytelling]] is on the battlefield, you need [[symbol:2]][[symbol:r]]
  - If [[Grinning Ignus]] is on the battlefield, you need [[symbol:2]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]]

Execution:
1. Cast [[Birgi, God of Storytelling]].
2. Cast [[Grinning Ignus]].
3. [[Birgi, God of Storytelling]] triggers, adding [[symbol:r]].
4. Use that [[symbol:r]] to activate [[Grinning Ignus]]'s ability.
5. Repeat from step 2.

Outcome:
- Infinite ETB triggers of your payoff.

Observations:
- [[Birgi, God of Storytelling]] can ramp a lot. Don't hesitate to use it if you know you'll take advantage of the extra mana it produces.
- If you have [[Birgi, God of Storytelling]] and [[Imperial Recruiter]], it's worth to tutor [[Grinning Ignus]].
- Sometimes you need to cast [[Harnfel, Horn of Bounty]] as a draw engine. Usually to draw [[Conspicuous Snoop]] after you cast [[Goblin Recruiter]].

===accordion
===panel: Grinning Ignus + Runaway Steamkin

Requires:
- [[Runaway Steamkin]] and [[Grinning Ignus]] in hand.
- An ETB payoff.
- [[symbol:3]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]]
  - If [[Grinning Ignus]] is on the battlefield, you need [[symbol:1]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]]
  - If [[Runaway Steamkin]] is on the battlefield, you need [[symbol:2]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]]
    - This is reduced by [[symbol:r]] for each +1/+1 counter on [[Runaway Steamkin]].

Execution:
1. Cast [[Runaway Steamkin]].
2. Cast [[Grinning Ignus]], triggering [[Runaway Steamkin]]'s ability, adding a +1/+1 counter on it.
3. Activate [[Grinning Ignus]]'s ability.
4. Repeat from step 2 until [[Runaway Steamkin]] has three +1/+1 counters.
5. Activate [[Runaway Steamkin]], removing three +1/+1 counters and adding [[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]].
6. Repeat from step 2.

Outcome:
- Infinite ETB triggers of your payoff.

Observations:
- Don't wait to cast [[Runaway Steamkin]], it's great to have it on the battlefield.
- If you have [[Runaway Steamkin]] and [[Imperial Recruiter]], it's worth to tutor [[Grinning Ignus]].

===accordion
===panel: Grinning Ignus + Defiler of Instinct + Witch's Clinic

Requires:
- [[Witch's Clinic]], [[Defiler of Instinct]] and [[Grinning Ignus]] in hand. 
- [[Purphoros, God of the Forge]] in the battlefield.
- A land drop available.
- [[symbol:6]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:rp]]
  - If [[Defiler of Instinct]] is on the battlefield, you need [[symbol:4]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:rp]]
  - If [[Grinning Ignus]] is on the battlefield, you need [[symbol:4]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]]

Execution:
1. Play [[Witch's Clinic]] and activate it's ability targetting [[Purphoros, God of the Forge]]. This will make you gain life from each of its triggers.
2. Cast [[Defiler of Instinct]].
3. Cast [[Grinning Ignus]] (paying 2 life).
4. Activate [[Grinning Ignus]]'s ability, adding [[symbol:2]][[symbol:r]].
5. Repeat from step 3. You can keep paying life because [[Purphoros, God of the Forge]]'s trigger will replenish it.

Outcome:
- Infinite ETB triggers. This causes infinite damage with Purphoros.

Observations:
- Probably not important, but you'll gain a lot of life. You will gain 2 times the amount of opponents you have, and pay only 2 per iteration.
- Each iteration adds [[symbol:r]] (since you pay life instead). Keep this in mind, as you'll have mana for interaction.
- This combo is almost imposible to pull, as we don't have reliable tutors for [[Witch's Clinic]].
- This combo only works with [[Purphoros, God of the Forge]]. Other ETB payoffs cannot gain lifelink.

===panel: Dualcaster Mage + Duplicator

The usual [[Dualcaster Mage]] and duplicator combo. As duplicators, we have [[Twinflame]] and [[Molten Duplication]].

Requires:
- [[symbol:2]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]] available
- Dualcaster Mage in hand
- Duplicator in hand
- Another creature under your control

Execution:
1.  Cast the duplicator targetting a creature you control.
2. Holding priority, cast [[Dualcaster Mage]].
3. When it enters the battlefield, target the duplicator with [[Dualcaster Mage]]'s triggered ability.
4. When the ability resolves, use the copied duplicator to target [[Dualcaster Mage]].
5. Repeat from step 3 as many times as you want. If Purphoros is on the battlefield, this will cause infinite damage.

Outcome:
- If Purphoros is on the battlefield, this causes infinite damage.
- If you don't have Purphoros, you can attack with infinite [[Dualcaster Mage]]s.

Observations:
- Do this in your pre-combat main phase if you plan to win attacking with the copied [[Dualcaster Mage]]s.
- If you have a piece of the combo, it's more valuable to use it rather than trying to assemble the combo. Don't hesitate to use any piece by itself.
  - Use [[Dualcaster Mage]] to copy a good spell.
  - Use your duplicators to copy your own creatures. There are many great ETB effects not to use them, waiting to assemble the combo.
- We don't use [[Heat Shimmer]], as it costs one more.
- [[Imperial Recruiter]] can tutor [[Dualcaster Mage]]. All pieces can be tutored with [[Gamble]], though that can be risky. See the first bullet point.
- In Purphoros, [[Dualcaster Mage]] can win on other player's turn. If they cast a duplicator (even if they hold priority for their own [[Dualcaster Mage]]), you can respond with your own, allowing you to combo on thir turn.
