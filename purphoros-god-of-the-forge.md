===panel: Introduction
In the early days of EDH, I used to play [[Norin the Wary]] chaos. Games lasted a long time and, in most cases, they weren't as fun as I thought they would be.

At a local Judge Conference around that time, I tried a [[Purphoros, God of the Forge]] deck and fell in love with it. The deck was focused and explosive. I did not look back and have been playing it since.

Have you ever played a platform game where you had to escape from an incoming threat, such as rising lava from below? I want this deck to feel that way for your opponents. The relentless ticking clock, with the end approaching faster and faster.

There are certainly a lot of different flavors to [[Purphoros, God of the Forge]], such as goblins or tokens. The deck can also be played with different budget restrictions. Throughout this primer, I'll share my thoughts and findings for this deck.

[[Purphoros, God of the Forge]] is the cornerstone of the deck.

It is indestructible and incredibly hard to remove, but suceptible to counterspells and exile-based removal.

Purphoros is the main win condition of the deck, by making it trigger enough times to burn your oppponents. We also have combo lines to close games quickly if you like.

Ideally, you need 20 Purphoros triggers to finish your opopnents. This decreases with combat damage and with damage enhancers.

Always aim to play [[Purphoros, God of the Forge]] as quickly as you can. You can do it as early as turn 3 with mana rocks, or turn 2 with a turn 1 [[Sol Ring]] or [[Mana Vault]].

Try not to play certain spells until [[Purphoros, God of the Forge]] is in the battlefield, to maximize their value.

Be careful if it becomes a creature, as it will be exposed to a lot of removal such as [[Swords to Plowshares]] and [[Path to Exile]]. Play with your Devotion and be careful not to over commit. Of course, Purphoros can punch for 6+, so it's worth to have it as a creature. Even as an indestructible blocker. Find the balance you need in each match. If there's a lot of white or blue, it will be exiled or returned to your hand at the worst moment.

===panel: How to play
You think that, as [[Purphoros, God of the Forge]] deals damage to each opponent, you need to keep life totals balanced and distribute damage equally. **DON'T**. Pick the opponent that you know will combo you out or control you, and remove them. Nothing personal. Others will follow their fate.

It is important to be aggresive and always make sure you are dealing combat damage whenever you can. Purphoros can enhance creature power, so a swarm of creatures can really hit hard, eliminating one opponent after the other. If a goblin token can deal more than 2 damage to an opponent, Purphoros smiles.

All life points will lower except yours. Everyone will quickly realize that you are sort of an archenemy. In this case, expect all hate go towards you. It happens. Don't feel bad or angry about it. If you don't like to be in that position, maybe this deck isn't for you.
===endpanel
===endaccordion

===accordion
===panel: Creatures
Purphoros decks favor an aggresive swarm strategy, usually with token generators or goblins.

This strategy not only is the best for triggering Purphoros multiple times, but also fully take advantage of its activated ability.

I think every creature in the deck needs to fill a role, and they must be the best at it.

Here are some thoughts on individual cards.

- [[Norin the Wary]]
  - Each turn cycle it should deal 4 triggers worth of damage. Games are blazing fast when Norin and Purphoros are both in play.
  - It is hard to remove, as is Purphoros.
- [[Agate Instigator]]
  - [[Impact Tremors]] effect on a creature. This means it triggers Purphoros.
  - It is even better if you cast it for its Offspring cost, dealing more damage. This is specially good if you have [[Torbran, Thane of Red Fell]].
  - You can use [[Witty Roastmaster]] too, but it's more expensive to cast.
- [[Grinning Ignus]]
  - A repeatable source of Purphoros triggers.
  - An amazing value piece on its own, and key part of certain combos.
- [[Neheb, the Eternal]]
  - An absolute powerhouse.
  - The turn it comes into play, it should add at least 6 [[symbol:r]].
  - If you have a lot of [[symbol:r]], you can finish the game with a big token generator spell like [[Tempt with Vengeance]].
  - You can kickstart the mana generation by looping [[Grinning Ignus]] in your main phase, add a ton of [[symbol:r]] then continue looping it in your second main phase. This is not infinite, but can be large enough to finish the game.
- [[Ornithopter of Paradise]], [[Iron Myr]]
  - Used as a turn 2 drop to have a turn 3 Purphoros.
  - Can trigger Purphoros if played afterwards.
  - Great budget options. I'd rather have ~~Mana Crypt~~ and ~~Jeweled Lotus~~.
    - Oh wait...
- [[Chandra's Spitfire]]
  - Against 3 opponents, a single Purphoros trigger causes 3 [[Chandra's Spitfire]]'s triggers, adding +9 power. This can take down a player very quickly.
  - [[Wildfire Elemental]] fills a similar role, but pumping all creatures instead. It can help with the swarm plan, but I'm not fond of it's extra mana cost and lack of evasion.
- [[Breya's Apprentice]], [[Redcap Gutter-Dweller]], [[Professional Face-Breaker]]
  - The extra tokens and Purphoros triggers are welcome.
  - The draw part is more important though. This can help your [[Conspicuous Snoop]] combo line.

===accordion
===panel: Damage enhancers
Cards that increase or duplicate damage are great. Prefer creatures, such as [[Solphim, Mayhem Dominus]] instead of enchantments like [[Furnace of Rath]]. You can take advantage of an enhanced trigger once they enter the battlefield. The enchantments do not trigger [[Purphoros, God of the Forge]].

Keep in mind that, since the opponent is the one receiving the damage, they have to choose how these apply.

Let's say you have [[Solphim, Mayhem Dominus]] and [[Torbran, Thane of Red Fell]]. Each trigger should deal `(2+2)*2=8` damage, but no, your opponent should chose the trigger to deal them `2*2+2=6` damage. As you see, the damage calculations can get messy with multiple enhancers.

By themselves, the best enhancers in my opinion are:
1. [[Torbran, Thane of Red Fell]]
  - Torbran enhances all damage from red sources. This includes combat damage, so things can get out of hand pretty quickly.
  - If paired with [[Impact Tremors]], each ETB will deal 7 damage (4 from [[Purphoros, God of the Forge]], 3 from [[Impact Tremors]]).
2. [[Ojer Axonil, Deepest Might // Temple of Power]]
  - Axonil only enhances non-combat damage.
  - If paired with [[Impact Tremors]], each ETB will deal 8 damage (4 from [[Purphoros, God of the Forge]], 4 from [[Impact Tremors]]).
  - You can pump Axonil with [[Purphoros, God of the Forge]]'s ability to deal more damage.
3. [[Solphim, Mayhem Dominus]]
  - Solphim only enhances non-combat damage.
  - If paired with [[Impact Tremors]], each ETB will deal 6 damage (4 from [[Purphoros, God of the Forge]], 2 from [[Impact Tremors]]).
  - This also doubles non-combat damage dealt to permanents, so [[Chandra's Incinerator]] will burn everything down.

From these, [[Ojer Axonil, Deepest Might // Temple of Power]] is the worst to pair with other enhancers. After the first enhancement, the damage is usually equal or greater than Axonil's power, therefore not affecting it.

===panel: Interaction
You can certainly play whatever interaction you want. If you do, make sure you can deal with things that really hurt you, such as [[Drannith Magistrate]], [[Torpor Orb]] or [[Hushbringer]]. Usually things like [[Chaos Warp]] and [[Wild-Magic Surge]] do the trick.

Do not play a lot of interaction though, we are monored. You need to play things in your turn rather than passing with mana open, expecting something.

[[Dualcaster Mage]] can also help in certain situations, if you are not expecting to combo with it.
===endpanel
===endaccordion

===accordion
===panel: Lands
- Fetchlands
  - Can fetch [[Dwarven Mine]], which can trigger Purphoros.
  - Can be replaced with mountains for budget purposes.
- [[Roadside Reliquary]], [[War Room]]
  - Draw in my lands? Yes please!
  - Roadside usually draws 2, since we play many artifacts and Purphoros is an Enchantment.
  - The draw can help your [[Conspicuous Snoop]] combo line.
- [[Arena of Glory]]
  - I was hesitant but this can cast a hasty [[Conspicuous Snoop]], so I'm sold on it.
- [[Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle]]
  - The effect is neat and we have tons of mountains, so in theory it is a good addition.
  - In practice though, this is a mountain that enters the battlefield tapped.
  - I have never benefitted from a single Valakut trigger in all my games.

If you have [[Conspicuous Snoop]] (without summoning sickness) and [[Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker]] on top of your deck, you can activate [[Conspicuous Snoop]] to make a hasty copy of itself and repeat the process. [[Goblin Recruiter]] can stack the top of your deck to cast the required goblins you need, and set [[Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker]] to pull the combo.

This works much better if you can draw a card. This way, you can play [[Goblin Recruiter]], put [[Conspicuous Snoop]] on top, draw it and proceed with the combo.

===accordion
===panel: Conspicuous Snoop + Torch Courier + Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker

Requires:
- [[Goblin Recruiter]] in hand.
- A way to draw a card.
- An ETB payoff.
- [[symbol:1]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]]
  - [[symbol:1]][[symbol:r]] for [[Goblin Recruiter]]
  - [[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]] for [[Conspicuous Snoop]]
  - [[symbol:r]] for [[Torch Courier]]

Execution:
1. Cast [[Goblin Recruiter]].
2. Tutor [[Conspicuous Snoop]], [[Torch Courier]] and [[Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker]]. Put them back in the top of your library in that order ([[Conspicuous Snoop]] should be on top).
3. Draw a card.
4. Cast [[Conspicuous Snoop]].
5. Cast [[Torch Courier]] from the top of your library. [[Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker]] should be on top of your library now.
6. Activate [[Torch Courier]] to give [[Conspicuous Snoop]] haste.
7. Activate [[Conspicuous Snoop]] to make a copy of itself.
8. Repeat step 7.

Outcome:
- Infinite ETB triggers of your payoff.

Observations:
- Be mindful of the number of cards you draw ([[Skullclamp]], [[Harnfel, Horn of Bounty]]). Look for an extra goblin if you want to keep [[Torch Courier]] on top. Although you can draw it and play it from your hand or exile regardless.
- If you have other ways to give [[Conspicuous Snoop]] haste, you can skip [[Torch Courier]].
- You can reduce the cost by [[symbol:r]] by looking for [[Skirk Prospector]] and placing it before [[Torch Courier]]. This lets you sacrifice [[Goblin Recruiter]] for an extra [[symbol:r]].

===accordion
===panel: No ETB payoff
What if you don't have [[Purphoros, God of the Forge]] or any other ETB payoff? The infinite copies of [[Conspicuous Snoop]] are tapped, and cannot attack. What do we do?

Requires:
- Infinite [[Conspicuous Snoop]] in play (by executing the previous combo)
- [[Goblin Recruiter]] in play.
- [[Skirk Prospector]] in play or library.
- [[Pashalik Mons]] in play or library.

Execution:
1. After you have infinite [[Conspicuous Snoop]], tap the last one to copy [[Goblin Recruiter]] instead of itself.
2. With the copied [[Goblin Recruiter]], tutor [[Skirk Prospector]] and [[Pashalik Mons]] to the top of your deck, in that order.
3. Sacrifice [[Conspicuous Snoop]]s to add [[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]].
4. Cast [[Skirk Prospector]] from the top.
5. Cast [[Pashalik Mons]] from the top.
6. Pass the turn. All [[Conspicuous Snoop]] will have to be sacrificed, each triggering [[Pashalik Mons]] enough times for you to win.

Outcome:
- Infinite [[Pashalik Mons]] triggers, dealing infinite damage.

Observations:
- If you have enough copies of [[Conspicuous Snoop]], you can use [[Skirk Prospector]] to sacrifice them and trigger [[Pashalik Mons]] in response to anything.

I love this creature. An amazing mana sink by itself. When looping [[Grinning Ignus]] for triggers, always be mindful about what zone should it end, in your hand or in the battlefield.

Say you have [[symbol:2]][[symbol:r]] to cast your [[Grinning Ignus]] for the first time and then N [[symbol:r]] mana available. You will have N additional Purphoros triggers, or (N-1) if [[Grinning Ignus]] ends in your hand (leaving [[symbol:2]][[symbol:r]] available).

If you have cost reducers such as [[Ruby Medallion]] or [[Hazoret's Monument]], each iteration will leave [[symbol:1]] available.

If you have [[Defiler of Instinct]], each iteration costs [[symbol:rp]], so if you have more life than your opponents, this can win you the game.

===accordion
===panel: Grinning Ignus + Birgi, God of Storytelling

Requires:
- [[Birgi, God of Storytelling]] and [[Grinning Ignus]] in hand.
- An ETB payoff.
- [[symbol:4]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]]
  - If [[Birgi, God of Storytelling]] is on the battlefield, you need [[symbol:2]][[symbol:r]]
  - If [[Grinning Ignus]] is on the battlefield, you need [[symbol:2]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]]

Execution:
1. Cast [[Birgi, God of Storytelling]].
2. Cast [[Grinning Ignus]].
3. [[Birgi, God of Storytelling]] triggers, adding [[symbol:r]].
4. Use that [[symbol:r]] to activate [[Grinning Ignus]]'s ability.
5. Repeat from step 2.

Outcome:
- Infinite ETB triggers of your payoff.

Observations:
- [[Birgi, God of Storytelling]] can ramp a lot. Don't hesitate to use it if you know you'll take advantage of the extra mana it produces.
- If you have [[Birgi, God of Storytelling]] and [[Imperial Recruiter]], it's worth to tutor [[Grinning Ignus]].
- Sometimes you need to cast [[Harnfel, Horn of Bounty]] as a draw engine. Usually to draw [[Conspicuous Snoop]] after you cast [[Goblin Recruiter]].

===panel: Grinning Ignus + Runaway Steamkin
Requires:
- [[Runaway Steamkin]] and [[Grinning Ignus]] in hand.
- An ETB payoff.
- [[symbol:3]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]]
  - If [[Grinning Ignus]] is on the battlefield, you need [[symbol:1]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]]
  - If [[Runaway Steamkin]] is on the battlefield, you need [[symbol:2]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]]
    - This is reduced by [[symbol:r]] for each +1/+1 counter on [[Runaway Steamkin]].

Execution:
1. Cast [[Runaway Steamkin]].
2. Cast [[Grinning Ignus]], triggering [[Runaway Steamkin]]'s ability, adding a +1/+1 counter on it.
3. Activate [[Grinning Ignus]]'s ability.
4. Repeat from step 2 until [[Runaway Steamkin]] has three +1/+1 counters.
5. Activate [[Runaway Steamkin]], removing three +1/+1 counters and adding [[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]].
6. Repeat from step 2.

Outcome:
- Infinite ETB triggers of your payoff.

Observations:
- Don't wait to cast [[Runaway Steamkin]], it's great to have it on the battlefield.
- If you have [[Runaway Steamkin]] and [[Imperial Recruiter]], it's worth to tutor [[Grinning Ignus]].

===panel: Grinning Ignus + Defiler of Instinct + Witch's Clinic

Requires:
- [[Witch's Clinic]], [[Defiler of Instinct]] and [[Grinning Ignus]] in hand. 
- [[Purphoros, God of the Forge]] in the battlefield.
- A land drop available.
- [[symbol:6]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:rp]]
  - If [[Defiler of Instinct]] is on the battlefield, you need [[symbol:4]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:rp]]
  - If [[Grinning Ignus]] is on the battlefield, you need [[symbol:4]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]]

Execution:
1. Play [[Witch's Clinic]] and activate it's ability targetting [[Purphoros, God of the Forge]]. This will make you gain life from each of its triggers.
2. Cast [[Defiler of Instinct]].
3. Cast [[Grinning Ignus]] (paying 2 life).
4. Activate [[Grinning Ignus]]'s ability, adding [[symbol:2]][[symbol:r]].
5. Repeat from step 3. You can keep paying life because [[Purphoros, God of the Forge]]'s trigger will replenish it.

Outcome:
- Infinite ETB triggers. This causes infinite damage with Purphoros.

Observations:
- Probably not important, but you'll gain a lot of life. You will gain 2 times the amount of opponents you have, and pay only 2 per iteration.
- Each iteration adds [[symbol:r]] (since you pay life instead). Keep this in mind, as you'll have mana for interaction.
- This combo is almost imposible to pull, as we don't have reliable tutors for [[Witch's Clinic]].
- This combo only works with [[Purphoros, God of the Forge]]. Other ETB payoffs cannot gain lifelink.

The usual [[Dualcaster Mage]] and duplicator combo. As duplicators, we have [[Twinflame]] and [[Molten Duplication]].

Requires:
- [[symbol:2]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]] available
- Dualcaster Mage in hand
- Duplicator in hand
- Another creature under your control

Execution:
1.  Cast the duplicator targetting a creature you control.
2. Holding priority, cast [[Dualcaster Mage]].
3. When it enters the battlefield, target the duplicator with [[Dualcaster Mage]]'s triggered ability.
4. When the ability resolves, use the copied duplicator to target [[Dualcaster Mage]].
5. Repeat from step 3 as many times as you want. If Purphoros is on the battlefield, this will cause infinite damage.

Outcome:
- If Purphoros is on the battlefield, this causes infinite damage.
- If you don't have Purphoros, you can attack with infinite [[Dualcaster Mage]]s.

Observations:
- Do this in your pre-combat main phase if you plan to win attacking with the copied [[Dualcaster Mage]]s.
- If you have a piece of the combo, it's more valuable to use it rather than trying to assemble the combo. Don't hesitate to use any piece by itself.
  - Use [[Dualcaster Mage]] to copy a good spell.
  - Use your duplicators to copy your own creatures. There are many great ETB effects not to use them, waiting to assemble the combo.
- We don't use [[Heat Shimmer]], as it costs one more.
- [[Imperial Recruiter]] can tutor [[Dualcaster Mage]]. All pieces can be tutored with [[Gamble]], though that can be risky. See the first bullet point.
- In Purphoros, [[Dualcaster Mage]] can win on other player's turn. If they cast a duplicator (even if they hold priority for their own [[Dualcaster Mage]]), you can respond with your own, allowing you to combo on thir turn.
